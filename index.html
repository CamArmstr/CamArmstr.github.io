    <h2>B2B Account Management (for Introverts)
	</h2>
	<p> I'm an introvert. People that know me well are sometimes surprised by this. I don't blame them, but I am fully, 100%, definitely an introvert.
	I've spent 10 years practicing public speaking and pretending to be an extrovert, but it's stressful every time I have to perform. That's ok. I have other strengths.</p>
	<p>So managing a B2B software company with constant account management is basically like hell for my introverted team every day. Even so, AdVon Commerce consistently gets comments like “You’re the best and easiest vendor that we work with”, “we really appreciate how on the ball you always are”, and “you never waste our time”. How do we do this when we get the weirdo sweats before every single call?</p>
<p>
Relationships are the key in B2B enterprises. Period. Full Stop.
</p>
<p>If you can’t build relationships, you can’t close any large scale enterprise deal. Companies don’t buy B2B products, people do.
</p>
<p>
Managing accounts well does 3 things: It keeps deals going in perpetuity. It builds trust for when something goes wrong (and it eventually will). It makes your fucking life easier because the clients will be happy their on the call with you.
</p>
<p>If you can’t converse your way out of a paper bag, then fear no more. Good account management is just consistently having good account management check ins and there are literally just 4 steps to having a good account management check in call. NOTE: There is technically one more skill to have here, which is triages when something explodes, but I’ll cover that sometime later.
</p>
<p>Every account management call I have with a client, strategic or otherwise, has four parts to the script</p>
<p>Phase 1:  Rapport Building - < 5 minutes <br>
Read the room. If someone is pissed, skip this step. If they’re not, say something positive. It doesn’t have to be clever, just smile while you say you’re excited about the sunshine. Most people on Zoom look and act like reanimated corpses and bitch about something. Customers don’t care about your baggage or even your good mood, but people respond to smiles and happiness because they have so little of it in their lives. 
If no one else is saying anything, start the conversation. They’re probably even worse at communication than you (because they’re not actively trying to improve their interpersonal kills like you are by reading this article). Get it going, ask about something in their background (their cat tree, the nice weather, the videogame sculptures they have, etc), and be positive. People appreciate it without realizing it and this preps them for positively receiving whatever you’re about to say to them about the business.
Smile. Just do it. Check yourself in the mirror to make sure you don’t look like a murderer.
</p>
<p>
Phase 2: Focus of the call - 5-10 minutes<br>
Performance of whatever thing you sell or how an effort or integration is going, etc. Highlight it if its good performance, instill confidence that there is a plan to fix it if it’s not going well. 
Give broader context - Things like you’re doing better than 70% of the market or everyone is struggling right now tells the client how they’re supposed to feel. Goal here is to make them feel good. You can fix the actual problems later, your core issue is fixing their feelings
If you have one, hit “The Ask”. Sometimes you need clients to do something. If so, make it one thing at a time. People can’t do more than one thing at a time and if you ask them to do so, they’ll fuck it up.
</p>
<p>
Phase 3: Open it up for Questions - <5 minutes <br>
“Is there any other way we can be helpful?” is how I transition to this one
Most of the time they won’t, but they’ll appreciate you asked and if they come up with one later, it turns it into their fault it wasn’t answered since you asked them this.
</p>
<p>
Phase 4: Closeout - <2 minutes<br>
Re-iterate the list of action items
Say something corporate-y like, “Glad we could get you some time back in your day!”
The whole call should’ve taken 20 minutes or less, so spend the last 10 minutes doing as much of the action items as possible so you don’t forget.
</p>
<p>
That’s it. Rinse and repeat with each client. Just do it and if you hit this 75% of the time you’ll wow all of your clients.
