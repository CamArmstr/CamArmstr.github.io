    <p>I try to be a <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles">first principles thinker</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a mostly complete list of my personal first principles.</p>
    <p>I'll update them as I change my mind</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The world is constructed entirely by people who are mostly winging it.
        </li>
        <li>
            People want to do zero work and make more money.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Everything is held together with duct tape.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Iteration at scale is more effective than any planning process could ever be.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If it doesn't make sense to you and you're mostly smart, you're probably right (but don't forget to wonder about what info you're missing).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            You CAN do anything you want to do...but you can't do EVERYTHING you want to do.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Nobody cares about your thing. That's both soul-crushing and liberating.
        </li>
        <br>


    </ul>
