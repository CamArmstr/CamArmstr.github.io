    <p>I try to be a <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles">first principles thinker</a>.</p>
    <p>This is a mostly complete list of my personal first principles.</p>
    <p>I update them as I change my mind</p>
    <br>
    <h5>First Principles</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The world is constructed entirely by people who are mostly winging it 
            <br>(and a lot of them don't realize that about themselves)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            People want to do zero work and make more money.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Everything is held together with duct tape.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Victories only compound if you make them. Losses compound if you let them. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            You can fix a bad decision. You can't fix "no" decision.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Strategy is about choice. Mostly the choice of what you're NOT doing.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Iteration at scale is more effective than any planning process could ever be.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            It's a lot easier to ride a wave than to create one, but there's much more value in the latter.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            If it doesn't make sense to you and you're mostly smart, you're probably right
            <br>(but don't forget to wonder about what information you might be missing)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Ideas are ONLY ever validated when they touch reality. 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Money spent is the strongest validation. Actions taken are the next strongest. 
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Words and shares are useful, especially for lightweight testing (but often misleading).
            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Likes are directionally helpful.  
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            You can do anything you want to do...but you can't do EVERYTHING you want to do.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Nobody cares about your thing. That's both soul-crushing and liberating.
        </li>
        <br>


    </ul>
